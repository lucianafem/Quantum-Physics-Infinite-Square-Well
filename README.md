# Quantum-Physics-Infinite-Square-Well

Problem to Solve in Python

1) Consider a particle of mass m in an infinite well of width a. Assuming the particle is in the ground state, calculate the density of probability as a function of x.  

2) What is the probability of finding the particle in the right half of the box, that is, between 0 and a/2? 

3) How likely is it to find it in the central half of the box, between â€“a/4 and a/4? 

4) Repeat items 1, 2 and 3, now assuming the particle is in the first excited state.
